# Final-Project-Network-Science

- `NTL_of_counties.ipynb` adds night time light time series as attributes to the network created by `Network_Creation.ipynb`. To run the code, ensure that `county_graph.gml` is in the working directory and download the night time light `.tif` files from our project folder number 14 (https://uzh.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/NetworkScienceHS24/EhnFsb0ubr9AqxtA4KFpKIoB73CMLJClc0SzJp8Z1c9uag?e=v0PniN) into a subfolder called `ntl_long_range`.
